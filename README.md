# TheBackPackProb
## An android application that solves the famous problem of backpack algorithm
### 1.Application ScreenShots:

<div display="inline-flex" flex-direction="rows" >
  <img src="appscreenshots/Screenshot_20201205-210655_The%20strawberry.jpg" width="150" />
  <img src="appscreenshots/Screenshot_20201205-210609_The%20strawberry.jpg" width="150" />
  <img src="appscreenshots/Screenshot_20201205-210620_The%20strawberry.jpg" width="150" />
</div>

### 2.What the application really does:

#### => takes your name and backpack size (localy only no internet).
#### => Gives you a selection of items that you desire to put in your backpack (currently offline and static, but you can get that data from an api if you want to).
#### => Calculates possibilities and gives you the best combination so you wont regret your choice.

## NOTE: the app is just an illustration of the famous algorithmic problem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#:~:text=The%20knapsack%20problem%20is%20a,is%20as%20large%20as%20possible." target="_blank" >look here.</a>
## If you want to make it an online app go ahead, just credit me for the idea and that's it.
